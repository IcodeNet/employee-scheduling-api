//The main point of the staging environment (servers, software and all) is that it's supposed to be quite close to the production environment :
//
//same versions of software
//same running daemons
//same kind of physical servers
//if using several servers in production, then have more than one server in staging -- to test load-balancing, for instance.
//some real data (maybe a subset of your production data)

// TODO: e.g. heroku is test env as it had different hardwer as AWS

// use json instead of javascript
